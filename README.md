# Next js Routing

- Basic Routing and dynamic routing
- created a fake api server using json server
- api data is as follows
### 
    "products":[
        {"id":1,"name":"Product 1","description": "Product One Description"},
        {"id":2,"name":"Product 2","description": "Product Two Description"}
    ]

- Wrap the above data in the curly brackets
- Signup and Login button are just for view they dont work
- Day 1 of next js 27-12-2023
- Hope I will be consistent
